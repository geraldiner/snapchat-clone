# Snapchat Clone

This is a project I created by following [Sonny Sangha](https://twitter.com/SonnySangha)'s [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kGISk5ft2w). Personally, I don't use Snapchat, but I was interested in figuring out how to use the webcam with React.

Since it's built on Firebase, the app features Google authorization and sign-in. Truth be told, the tutorial used an older version of the Firebase packages, so I had to make do with a slight detour to the documentation for the newer syntax.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Firebase

The app is built with Firebase, primarily using authentication and database. This was my first time using it, so I relied heavily on the tutorial to walk me through it. However, as previously mentioned, the tutorial uses an older syntax, so I did have to read the documentation about the newer syntax.

The frontend uses React, which I am more comfortable with. It also uses Redux for keeping a global store, which I am less comfortable with. I'll admit I had to watch that part a couple times to fully grasp what was happening. And of course, I read the docs too.

## Lessons Learned

This app was really cool because it uses the person's webcam to take photos and store them in a database online. It then generates a feed with all those photos. ...(Un)fortunately, for me, all the photos are just of me (lol), but in the video tutorial, there were people from all over the world logging in to showcase their photos. I thought that was really cool and makes me excited about building new things.
